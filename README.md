Machine learning can be used to predict customer churn for Sprint. The steps outlined below show how a machine learning model can be built to identify at-risk customers and take measures to prevent them from leaving the company.

### **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
Collect historical data on customer churn, including customer demographics, usage patterns, contract details, and past churn instances. Ensure the data is clean and well-structured.
### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Conduct EDA to understand the dataset better. Analyze the distribution of features, identify missing values, and explore correlations between variables. EDA helps in feature selection and engineering.
### **Feature Engineering**
Create new features or transform existing ones that might have predictive power. For example, you can calculate metrics like customer tenure, average monthly usage, or customer lifetime value.
### **Data Splitting**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
### **Selecting a Machine Learning Algorithm**
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. Common algorithms for churn prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
### **Model Training**
Train the selected machine learning model on the training dataset. The model will learn patterns from historical data to predict customer churn.
### **Hyperparameter Tuning**
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance. Techniques like cross-validation and grid search can help identify the best hyperparameters.
### **Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Additionally, consider using a confusion matrix to understand false positives and false negatives.
### **Handling Class Imbalance**
Churn datasets often have a class imbalance, where the number of customers who stay far exceeds those who leave. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using algorithms like SMOTE can address this issue.
### **Model Interpretability**
Ensure the model's predictions are interpretable. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can help explain the model's decisions.
### **Deployment**
Once the model performs well on the testing set, deploy it to a production environment where it can be used to make real-time predictions.
### **Monitoring and Maintenance**
Continuously monitor the model's performance in production. Periodically retrain the model with updated data to ensure its accuracy over time.
### **Feedback Loop**
Implement a feedback loop to collect data on actual customer churn outcomes. Use this feedback to improve the model's performance and maintain its accuracy.
### **Customer Retention Strategies**
Finally, use the model's predictions to implement targeted customer retention strategies. Identify high-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering personalized incentives or customer support.


A sample code for the above process using mock data generated on mockeroo

'''python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/python/Lux academy/DataScience_Bootcamp/customer_data.csv")

# Data preprocessing: One-hot encoding for categorical features
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=["first_name", "last_name", "country", "favorite_color"])


# Define features and target variable
X = data_encoded.drop("customer_satisfaction", axis=1)       # Features
y = data_encoded["customer_satisfaction"].astype(float)       # Target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a machine learning model (Random Forest in this example)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(report)
